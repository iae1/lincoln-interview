# Lincoln Full-Stack Engineer Take-Home Project

This take-home project is designed to simulate real world client work. It should take up to only a few hours to complete. Please work at your own pace and comfort.

Any ambiguity found in the task is intentional; we want to see how you navigate decision trees and how you defend your choices. Approach this as you would approach a task given by a real client.
